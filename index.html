<p>SpaceWarps is a Zooniverse project, 
to be launched in Spring 2013, that will crowd-source the discovery of gravitational lenses. 
While the Zooniverse dev team are building the main site, identification interface, and discussion and exploration system, 
the science team are developing a number of prototype webpages to help our volunteers learn 
about gravitational lenses - what they look like, and how they work - as quickly as possible.</p>

<h3>The Spotter's Guide</h3>

<p>We want to show people what lenses look like - and what they don't! The Spotter's Guide will be an 
interactive gallery of both known lenses and some common sources of confusion, that are 
relevant to the current survey's data.</p>

Under construction...

<h3>Gravitational Lens Playground</h3>

<p>We have built a little lens simulator, called "LensToy," to show people very quickly what gravitational lenses
 do - you place a source "behind" a massive galaxy in the image shown to you, and LensToy shows you what the 
 corresponding lensed features would look like.

<h3>Gravitational Lens School</h3>

<p>We'd like people to understand a bit about how spacewarps work - so on the School page, we try and explain the physics of gravitational lensing.'
