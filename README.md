Space Warps
-----------

Crowd-sourced discovery of gravitational lenses. We are a Zooniverse project,
which launched in Spring 2013 at [http://spacewarps.org](http://spacewarps.org). This repository contains code and documentation
being developed by the science team.

Two papers on the first dataset we searched for lenses, the CFHTLS, are:

* [Marshall et al 2015: *"Space Warps I: Crowd-sourcing the Discovery of Gravitational Lenses"*](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/SpaceWarps/raw/master/doc/sw-system.pdf)
* [More et al 2015: *"Space Warps II: New Gravitational Lens Candidates from the CFHTLS Discovered through Citizen Science"*](https://github.com/drphilmarshall/SpaceWarps/raw/master/doc/sw-cfhtls.pdf)

The web app itself is being developed [here](https://github.com/zooniverse/Lens-Zoo) as part of the [Zooniverse](http://zooniverse.org) project. If you are interested in building a site like Space Warps using Zooniverse techology, keep an eye on their website or drop them a line.
